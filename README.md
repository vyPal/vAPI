# vAPI
I was bored to I just made a app for serving a couple random API endpoints.

## Available routes
### `/ping`
Sends a ping to the server to make sure it's running
### `/is_even/{number}`
Checks whether the number is even
### `/is_odd/{number}`
Checks whether the number is odd
### `/is_even_or_odd/{number}`
Checks if the number is even or odd

## Rate limits
There are none (I was too lazy), so feel free to use as much as you want, but pls don't DDoS :D

## Adding new routes
This repo is always open to new additions. Feel free to make a fork and create a PR!

I don't really care what is added as long as it's reasonible, doesn't use a ton of compute and doesn't break any laws.
